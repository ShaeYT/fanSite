	<h1>What's Anime All About???</h1>
</div>
<body>
<p> Anime is all about plot and action. Different animes give off different emotions. For Example, Dragon Ball makes me excited and think I can fight. Naruto keeps me interested and want to learn more about specific clans. It also makes me feel like a ninja. Anime has been a wonderful part of my life. The first anime I ever watched was Dragon Ball Z and at the moment I didn,t even know it was classified as an Anime. I just watched it because my brother said it was interesting. After I watched Naruto for a while, I started to understand all about the different levels as a shinobi and jutsus.
